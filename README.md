## Overiview

In this project I had to create and ETL pipeline to extract data from Wikipedia and Kaggle in JSON and CSV formats, then the Data is transformed into Pandas data franes. Last after the data manipulation we connect to the database using sqlalchemy library to load the data in Postgresql.
